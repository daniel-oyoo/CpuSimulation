# CPU Simulation Project

A Java-based CPU, Cache, and Main Memory simulator demonstrating computer architecture concepts.

## Features
- CPU with register operations (ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE)
- Cache memory with LRU replacement policy
- Main memory simulation
- Detailed operation logging
- Performance statistics

## How to Run
1. Open in IntelliJ IDEA
2. Run Main.java
3. Watch the simulation in action!

## Architecture
- CPU: Handles arithmetic operations and register management
- Cache: Implements cache hits/misses with LRU eviction
- Main Memory: Data storage with random access patterns
